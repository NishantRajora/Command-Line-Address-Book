# Command-Line-Address-Book
DSA 3rd sem project
To implement a command-line address book in Java that supports adding, deleting, searching, saving to a file, and restoring data while ensuring efficient search operations (under one second for up to a million entries), you can use a B-Tree or B+ Tree for external searching and file handling for persistence. Additionally, you can incorporate string matching algorithms like KMP or Rabin-Karp to speed up name searches.
